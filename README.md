# World_Weather_Analysis
### Overview
In this analysis, we were tasked with modifying the PlanMyTrip app functions to incorporate weather descriptions, filters by weather preference, and the addition of a travel map and itinerary created based off of the users input. For this project, we began by analyzing weather data which was gathered from Open Weather Map API, in addition to Google Maps Directions API, which allowed for us to create a travel route between four chosen cities and a subsequent marker layer map.
